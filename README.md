# Simulating shape containerization in looped space

- When you have looped space, meaning that when you reach one end, you appear at the other end, shapes become containers since they encapsulate everything
- I wanted to visualize this by projecting the perspective of the shape onto a non-looped plane
- The projection is generated by casting a ray from every angle and seeing how far it travels before hitting a side of the shape in a looped instance
- It then colors in a dot relative to the canvas size depicting how far the surface the ray hit is
